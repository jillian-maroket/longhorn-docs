## Release Labels

Each release is supported for 14 months (12 months of support and 2 months for upgrades). Only the two most recent minor releases receive security and bug fixes. For more information, see the [Support Matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-longhorn/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/).

- **Dev**: The software is under active development and has not been thoroughly tested. Upgrading from earlier versions or to later versions is not supported. Use this version only for testing purposes.

- **Latest**: The software has passed all stages of verification and testing. All remaining known issues are considered acceptable. Use this version only for testing purposes.

- **Stable**: The software is considered reliable and free of critical issues. This version is recommended for general use.

- **EOL**: The software has reached the end of its useful life and no further code-level maintenance is provided. You may continue to use the software within the terms of the licensing agreement. Upgrading to a stable version is recommended.

> **Note**:
>
> Longhorn provides documentation for new features, enhancements, and bug fixes implemented in major, minor, and patch releases.

## Feature Labels

Features that are labeled **Experimental** and **Technical Preview** provide glimpses into upcoming innovations and offer opportunities to test new technologies within your environment.

- **Experimental**: The feature is incomplete but its essential functionality is operational. Tests in a controlled environment have shown that it can coexist with existing stable features. Because of the missing components and/or evolving functionality, the feature is not recommended for use in production environments.

- **Technical Preview**: The feature is almost complete and its functionality is not expected to change significantly. Tests in a controlled environment have shown that it can coexist with existing stable features. Explore the feature extensively before using in production environments.

These features have the following limitations:

- Are still in development and may be functionally incomplete, unstable, or in other ways unsuitable for production use.
- Are not supported.
- May only be available for specific hardware architectures. Details and functionality are subject to change. As a result, upgrading to subsequent releases may be impossible and may require a fresh installation.
- Can be removed from the product at any time. This may occur, for example, if SUSE discovers that the feature does not meet customer or market needs, or does not comply with enterprise standards.

> **Note**:
> 
> **Experimental** and **Technical Preview** features are usually disabled by default. The documentation provides information about how you can enable and configure such features.

## Admonitions

Admonitions are text blocks that provide additional or important information. Each text block is marked with a special label and icon.

- **Important**: Information that requires special attention, such as changes in product behavior.

- **Tip**: Helpful advice and suggestions, such as alternative methods of completing a task.
